# Wacky Flip 🎮
A chaotic, physics-driven platformer where ragdolls rule and gravity has lost its mind.

Welcome to Wacky Flip – an outrageously fun and unpredictable 2D physics platformer where your only goal is to flip, flop, crash, and somehow make it to the finish line. Built for laughs, fails, and creative gameplay, [Wacky Flip](https://wackyflip.org/) embraces absurdity with intentionally floppy mechanics, unpredictable movement, and creatively hazardous levels that turn every run into a highlight reel.

## 🚀 Features
Physics-Based Movement – Every step, stumble, and flip is powered by a custom ragdoll physics system designed for unpredictability and fun.

Original Art and Sound – Whimsical visuals, silly sound effects, and a high-energy soundtrack keep the vibe playful and chaotic.

Dozens of Levels – From trampoline towers to low-gravity arenas and lava loops, every level is a new challenge in balance and patience.

Insane Replayability – The randomness of the physics keeps every attempt fresh. There’s no one “right” way to play – just your way.

Built With Unity – Clean, extensible codebase structured for Unity (URP), with modular level and player control systems.
